{"reviewerID":"ADH0O8UVJOT10","asin":"B0043RZ9QQ","reviewerName":"stormjh1","helpful":[2,2],"reviewText":"for those unfamiliar with vox s amplug products these things are amazing i m just old enough to remember some of the portable options of the 1990 s and they were mostly terrible what vox has done with these tiny headphone amplifiers which weigh virtually nothing run for 10 15 hours on 2 aaa batteries and plug directly into the guitar is nothing short of amazing they have incredible amp like tone and get as loud as you can possibly want even through a pair of 20 sony headphones they sound amazing the star of the collection in my opinion is the vox ac30 amplug which does a great vintage tube amp ranging from sparkling cleans to top boost overdrive if you haven t played an amplug before the ac30 one is 39 99 of the best money you ll ever spend now getting to this specific joe satriani amplug it s impossible to talk about the tone without talking about the guitarist himself fans of joe satriani even casual ones will recognize elements of this sound right away satriani has a very distinctive sound which he crafted over the years using a modified boss ds 1 distortion and more recently his vox satchurator distortion box it s a thick lead tone with a nice sustain and colored with a delay effect both of those elements are present on this signature amplug you have a level control a gain control and a tone control there s also three switch positions off on and fx the fx position engages the delay effect but the tone is otherwise the same pros first the price retails at 49 99 whereas most of the other models are 39 99 i believe the lead amplug is also 49 99 and also has a delay feature i think that the added delay feature and unique tone are worth the extra money but this is admittedly a sort of niche product overall however you have several amplugs to choose from and if you choose this one 49 99 is still an incredible value for the ability to play your guitar virtually anywhere and enjoy quality tone the tone has a real sweet spot between 3 and 5 that really makes it enjoyable to play lead notes while it isn t necessarily and ideal rhythm guitar distortion you can hit rich chords with nice sustain i prefer the tone on the higher gain levels and you can really crank it up if you want to but it sounds great at lower volumes too the delay is also surprisingly good it s probably set to around the 400 milisecond gap which is pretty standard adds a cool echo fullness to your solo progressions much like a classic satriani solo again the overall tone is fantastic with the amount of gain provided you can play most types of rock and dabble into metal guitar a bit though i ve always thought of satch of more a technical melodic guitarist than a metal guitarist cons there are a few things to know about the satriani signature model but i don t think any of them should discourage you from checking it out while the delay is surprisingly good you can t customize it you can t make the repeats shorter or longer and you can t adjust the timing of the repeats keep in mind that this is mostly a practice device for your personal use however and i still enjoy using the delay as for the tone which i mostly discussed as a pro in the paragraph above you should be aware that this is not meant to be a clean signal it is possible to get a somewhat clean tone by rolling back on the gain or lowering the volume of your guitar but it s mostly distortion or bust the durability of all of the amplugs has also been questioned by some the device is very lightweight and all plastic except for the metal plug portion i don t doubt that you could bang it on something and break it quite easily the switches and dials may also fail over time but frankly at 40 or 50 it s probably a better value than making it out of heavy duty metal and charging 100 for it which would lock more people out of the market i would certainly buy another one or several if any of mine broke finally there as an audible hiss noise through your headphones anytime the device is on slightly annoying when you re not playing but i don t notice it at all once i start playing notes the verdict one other dirty little secret to point out about these things in addition to the aux jack which allows you to plug in an mp3 player and jam along it is possible to use a 1 8 to 1 4 adapter and audio cable to plug this thing directly into an amp pa or anything with speakers you might be surprised how good it sounds as an after note i wrote most of this review playing on my jackson dr6 which has two seymour duncan humbuckers and it sounded great i later tried it on a gibson les paul which is usually my primary guitar and despite the fact it also has two humbuckers it did not sound as good the distortion was much more fizzy haven t tried it with single coil pickups but i think that it would likely work well with a strat type guitar due to the overall roundness of the tone the amplug is a great invention that allows so many players to log endless hours practicing irrespective of their budget or living situation the satriani model brings its own special character to the series and if you like the tone as much as i do might become an instant favorite","overall":5,"summary":"thick satriani lead tones on the go","unixReviewTime":1351036800,"reviewTime":"10 24,

year broadcast and voiceover career i have used or been forced to use every other large diaphragm studio mic on the planet along with the shure sm7b and it s predecessors the sm7 and sm5 large diaphragm dynamics have some notable advantages over condenser microphones for voiceover work and solo vocalists in multi track studio work i ve used over the years the sennheiser md421 ev re20 ev re27n d shure sm7b shure sm7 shure sm5 and most recently tried a heil pr 40 sometimes this was not of my own selection but i just used what was available of the lot the shure sm7b is my favorite of the ones still available the sm7b is a better shielded sm7 and the sm7b of today has a better shock mount than the old sm7 or earlier sm7b the shielding in the b model minimizes rfi from computer monitors florescent lighting radio transmitter proximity etc the sm7 was a redesign of the sm5 i consider the sm5 to have been the very best vocal dynamic microphone ever created but it hasn t been in production in ages i have used a few ribbon microphones that were also pretty good such as the rca 77dx and rca 44 but they were not as good as the sm5 or sm7 or sm7b today s sm7b is the best non condenser vocal microphone still in production stop looking and buy one you will not find a better microphone for voice work whether singing or spoken word it has a very controllable proximity effect something that is missing from the ev s i can play a sm7b like a violin the others i just don t seem to have nearly as much proximity effect to toy with for dramatic impact everything that is good about condensers for voice work is in an sm7b while everything that is bad about condensers for voice work isn t dj s change jobs a lot and i got tired of finding the ev re20 re27n d mics or the sennheiser everywhere i went so i bought my own sm7b i never liked the ev s or sennheiser much and didn t ever feel like they were much of a tool the heil pr 40 is pretty good but doesn t have any on board eq options for recording not having the eq is probably no big deal as you can tweak it in post production but for live radio you can t do much of that the sm7b is a tool for skilled vocal talent so if you are trying to make a novice sound good you might do better with an re27n d but for someone who actually knows how to really work a microphone over then the sm7b is only dynamic large diaphragm mic i know of that can deliver everything a real voice artist has to give the reason is that this microphone is designed for one thing voice work the others are more versatile but the sm7b is the voice microphone and that was all it was intended to be it has however found secondary duty as a bass cab microphone and it is pretty good at recording some very loud and boomy sound effects but it is primarily a vocal microphone of all the instruments that have ever been recorded or broadcast the human voice is the most complex and difficult to capture reliably that is one reason vocals sound good on a 4 000 tube condenser microphone since it can capture all the complexity inflection and multi frequency overtones of the human voice unfortunately even these very best condensers also pick up lots of things you didn t intend and also have at least a trace of self generated noise if you are doing a dry voiceover you can t hide the hiss of a condenser under something else with the sm7b you don t have to even for singing this microphone is sort of a secret weapon that kids calling themselves recording engineers today are usually totally ignorant about they figure anything short of a multi thousand dollar tube condenser microphone is inferior for studio vocals and this microphone proves them wrong if you want a good all around microphone this is not it if you want the best dynamic vocal microphone here it is as others have mentioned the output needs a decent preamp but works with all the pro studio gear i ve ever connected to it i think if you have some cheap usb interface then you will want to put another preamp in front of it and that will make it far more usable for recording whispers most real studio preamps are a good match for it i ve plugged it into some real junky mixers and had it work too you need at least 60 db of gain the spec sheet actually says 59 70 db would be better lots is made of the low output of 59 db but it isn t all that much less than the shure sm58 which is 54 5 db 4 5 db isn t much at all for any decent mic preamp but again most of the one box solution usb interfaces with built in mic preamps is probably going to need some help as they were designed with the hotter output of a condenser in mind the shure sm7b comes with the built in shock mount in the stand mounting and yoke attachments every other large diaphragm dynamic has a shock mount made for it but it costs extra they all need an external windscreen but only the sm7b comes with one i got mine 10 years ago when it still came with two windscreens it has a nice metal case for storage travel i think now they just come with one windscreen which is the bigger one shure calls the a7ws but still come in the metal case i use the smaller windscreen mostly and shure calls them the rk345 and their distributors still carry them the smaller windscreen makes the microphone more open and airy for me and i d suggest getting one of the rk345 s but that is the only accessory you ll need to add the windscreens are held on by some little velcro tabs but easily interchanged they are also very durable for foam screens on the back end of the tube is a round plate you remove with a hex key and under the plate are multiple eq adjustments for flat bass rolloff presence boost settings that you can fiddle with to get the sound you like best you can just leave the plate off if you want this is easily the most eq flexibility of any large diaphragm dynamic so i m just adding my two cents worth here and joining the others who pretty much all agree this thing rules for voice work i should have written this review earlier but wanted to try the new heil pr 40 first to make sure i was still an sm7b guy and it took a while for the heil tryout to happen since i didn t want to actually buy one i still am an sm7b guy i would give it 4 5 stars but it won t let me do that since there is nothing better right now in the class i rounded it up to 5 stars but the sm5 was actually a bit closer to a 5 star vocal mic","overall":5,"summary":"the best vocal dynamic microphone still in production","unixReviewTime":1354147200,"reviewTime":"11 29, 2012","label":2}
